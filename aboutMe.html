    <p> Keyah Fuller is my name, and I am 15 years old. I am in my senior year of high school and live in Belize City, Belize.

      What drove me to chose this issue is that we are in the midst of a pandemic, and while people are panicking and wondering, they are unconcerned about those who are homeless.
<br>
      They, too, want assistance and are frequently disregarded. Even before the outbreak, they were chased away and unable to provide assistance.
<br>
      People needed to be more aware of their existence and recognize its significance, as they were once like us. </p>
