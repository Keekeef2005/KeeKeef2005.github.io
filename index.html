<h1>FAITH FOR THE HOMELESS</h1>

     <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
     <p>Faith For the Homeless' purpose is to assist those who are currently homeless. The homeless are offered hope for society and a better future by those who help them. They will see the meaning of living in comfort once again. </p>

<h2>Social Problem </h2>
     <p>Homelessness is a problem because it puts people in a vulnerable and frequently hazardous situation.</p>
     <p> Homeless persons have restricted access to basic cleanliness, food, warmth, and healthcare since they do not have a place to reside. It is especially problematic for children, as homeless children perform poorly in school and are unable to meet their most basic needs. </p>

</div class="one">
     <h2>Causes</h2>
   <h4>1. Individual and Relational Factors</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> <p> Someone may become homeless as a result of a divorce or a severe break-up. This is especially true for mothers and children. The majority of homeless mothers who find up in family shelters are victims of domestic violence.</p></li>
  <li><p>The loss of a loved one can have a significant impact on us. It can lead to sadness and an inclination to "let go." Loss of a parent or both parents can place children in a vulnerable position and raise their chances of becoming homeless. Most of those who don't have someone ready to take them in end up hopping from one foster family to the next. Those who are too old for the foster system find up in shelters or, in the worst-case scenario, on the streets.</p></li>
<li>  <p>We're all addicted to something. However, some addictions can completely devastate people's life. Unfortunately, our society's pre-programmed response to addiction, particularly to heroin and cocaine, is unending criticism. People who are supposed to aid them frequently mock them. As a result, many of them become homeless.</p> </li>
    </ul>

<br>
<h3> 2. Structural Factors </h3>
<ul>
  <li><p>Not all homeless persons are unemployed, contrary to popular opinion. Some of them hold down full-time employment. Unfortunately, they don't make enough money to cover their rent.</p></li>
<li><p>The demand for housing is increasing as more people move to cities. Rents have soared as a result. People in large cities now have to spend more than half of their monthly income just on rent. As a result, low-income earners are forced to live in their automobiles or in shelters.</p></li>
<li><p>Education aids in the acquisition of a higher-paying job. Regrettably, it is not available to all of us. Those who don't frequently end up working in low-wage mundane occupations â€” if they can find work at all. They can't afford to rent, let alone buy a house, because they don't have a job.</p></li>

<h2> Effects</h2>

<h3> 1. On an Individual </h3>
<!--on a individual bold-->
<ul>
  <li><p>Sleeping on the ground and being exposed to the elements might be hazardous to one's health. Furthermore, not eating on a regular basis can weaken one's immune system. As a result, homeless persons are more vulnerable to sickness, especially during the winter and flu season. This includes tuberculosis, cardiovascular disease, HIV/AIDS, and skin ailments.</p></li>
  <li><p>When a person loses their home, they may also lose everything they own and everything they have ever worked for. As a result, their self-esteem may suffer as a result. It has an impact on their self-esteem and how they perceive themselves, which can lead to depression and other mental diseases.</p></li>
  <li><p>While substance addiction causes many people to lose their homes, it is also one of the most serious repercussions of homelessness. According to research, more than a third of the homeless population suffers from drug and alcohol addiction. According to another study, up to two-thirds of those suffering homelessness have a history of alcoholism and drug misuse.</p></li>
  <li><p>Learning to be violent is a necessary part of surviving on the streets. As a result, aggression has become the norm for many chronically homeless persons. So, if a person already struggles with anger management before being homeless, living on the streets will further enhance their violent tendencies. Needless to say, this might be a security risk not just for the homeless individual, but also for the rest of the community.</p></li>
<li><p>Homeless women with mental illnesses are at a 97 percent risk of being violently abused. As a result, sexual assault and harassment are extremely widespread among them. While 27% of homeless men and 38% of transgender persons have reported being raped, This is the rate of sexual abuse among homeless persons.</p></li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>2. On Society </h3>
  <ul>
 <li><p>According to studies, the government spends more on public services for the homeless than it does on housing. And that money came from your taxes. So, before you shrug and suggest that the country's homelessness crisis doesn't truly bother you, consider again.</p></li>
<li><p>Homelessness intensifies the already-existing social obstacles. It emphasizes the country's wealth divide, which creates hatred and division among the people.</p></li>
<li><p>Homeless persons are not only more susceptible to illness, but they are also more likely to spread infectious diseases. This may endanger public health, particularly during epidemics.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>What Can We Do to Bring an End to Homelessness</h2>
<li><p>The first step toward ending homelessness is changing the public's view of it. Begin by informing your family, neighbors, and friends about homelessness.</p></li>
<li><p>Many local charities, including as soup kitchens and shelters, actively assist the homeless and are always looking for volunteers.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of blaming the homeless, consider putting yourself in their position. Understand where they're coming from and how they got into such a mess.</p>
<p>Homelessness cannot be eradicated overnight or alone through the efforts of the government. It's a tragic cycle that has and will continue to damage many generations. According to the Department of Health, keeping people off the streets will need more than just providing suitable accommodation. Everyone, from government officials to private citizens, must work together to accomplish this. We can all work together to make the world a better place.</p>
